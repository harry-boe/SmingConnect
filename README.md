# SmingConnect

Sming Connect is a managment portal to maintain security arround Sming IoT Devises and application build arround them.

Core features include:

  Managment of applications or application services
  Each sming device is part of a biggerqeko system identified by the application service.
  All devices that participate on that oeko system will bi identified and autheticcated using certifcates issued by this portal
  
  CA and managment of certificaes for services, firmware and devices
  
  Firmware managment. This includes signing and secure deployment of Sming firmware binaries over the air
  
  Device managment. This feature allows to create unique identifiers and key for devices that can be used for strong authetication. This identities are created during a binding process between device and application service.
  
Most of the features described above are build on top of Sming security features which are still under development.
  
  
  Note: the implementation here is work in progress and far of from complete .. but feel free to canteact me if you like to participate on that project.
